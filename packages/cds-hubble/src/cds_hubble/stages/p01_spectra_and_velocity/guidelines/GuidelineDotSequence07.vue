        With a wisdom of crowds approach, we hope to see <b>consensus</b> in everyone's measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>consensus</b>: measurements tend to cluster around a single value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>no consensus</b>: measurements are scattered across a range of values or clustered around more than one value.
      </p>
