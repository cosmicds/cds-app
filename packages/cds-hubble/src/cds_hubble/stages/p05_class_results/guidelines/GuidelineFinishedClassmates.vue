        Note: "Your class" refers to you and the {{ state_view.class_data_size - 1 }} others who have completed their measurements (and might not represent your entire class). To avoid confusion, we will <b>not</b> add new measurements as they come in, so you may obtain different results from classmates who complete their measurements after you.
