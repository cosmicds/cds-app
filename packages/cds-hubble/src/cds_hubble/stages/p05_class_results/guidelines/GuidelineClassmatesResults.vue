        Letâ€™s look at your class's data, student by student. Someone in your class measured the lowest age value for the universe. Someone measured the highest age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the slider to scan through the age estimates that each person in your class measured. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your value appears in {{ state_view.my_color }}, and your classmates' are {{ state_view.my_class_color }}.
