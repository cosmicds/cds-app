      Perhaps even more important than the range of ages is <b>how those ages are distributed</b>. If most of the measurements are bunched closely together, that gives us more confidence than
      if they are spread across a large range of values or are bunched around multiple values. As with the dot plots you saw earlier, more <b>consensus</b> in measurements generally gives us more <b>confidence</b> in a result.
